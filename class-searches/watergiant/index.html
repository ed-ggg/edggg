                <p>There is only one known Green Water Giant, yet is probably the most significant. This discovery was proof that not just standard (hydrogen & helium based) 
                    gas giants were capable of generating a green variant. As Water Giants share their colors and cloud patterns with Gas Giants with Water-Based Life, their green variants
                    also show some similarity with them as well. Green Water Giants might be the key to gathering more information on green GGWBLs, as both classes have planets turn green at the exact 
                same temperature, 158.000000 K. If another green Water Giant shows up at a new temperature, green GGWBLs might also be green at that temperature too.
